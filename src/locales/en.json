It challenges the idea of a gallery as static architecture, instead treating it as a living interface between creator and audience. Each exhibition is a narrative told through layout, rhythm, and silence.\n\n---\n\nI created Officina Artis as a way to merge my passions for visual design, code, and contemporary art. It‚Äôs a self-directed experiment that pushes the boundaries of interaction and curatorial storytelling in virtual environments.\n\nAs Creative Director and Developer, I handled every aspect‚Äîfrom the spatial design and lighting to the code that powers movement and ambiance. The result is an elegant, contemplative digital space that reimagines how we engage with artworks online.\n\nOfficina Artis represents my personal design philosophy: minimal, poetic, experimental, and deeply human-centered. It‚Äôs not just a tech demo‚Äîit‚Äôs a statement about how form, space, and code can evoke emotion and presence in the digital age."

My work combined strategy, design, and technology to build websites that connected users with educational opportunities.\n\nI led the visual and frontend development of over 20 active websites, including university sites, content aggregators, and blogs. Together with my team‚Äîdesigners and HTML/CSS developers‚Äîwe handled everything from wireframes and visual design to frontend implementation and code reviews. We also supported the marketing team with quick-turnaround solutions like landing pages, campaign assets, and form optimizations that improved conversion rates.\n\nA significant part of my work involved migrating and redesigning outdated websites to .NET Core. This process included aligning the brand identity of each educational institution and enhancing user experience across platforms. We successfully migrated five client university websites and established a reusable base system that allowed us to launch seven new sites for incoming partners faster and more efficiently.\n\nOne of my biggest achievements was the standardization of the student portal. Previously, each site had its own version, requiring individual updates. I designed a modular, unified portal interface that adapted to different institutions with minimal CSS changes. This greatly streamlined development, reduced maintenance time, and delivered a consistent experience to all users.\n\nI also led the redesign of content aggregators to ensure visual consistency across platforms, even though they pulled data from different sources. We achieved a cohesive look and feel using dynamic visual adjustments like color schemes, imagery, and localized branding.\n\nThroughout this role, I used tools such as Figma, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET Core, Jira, and SourceTree. Accessibility and SEO were integrated into every deliverable by default.\n\nBeyond the technical skills, this experience sharpened my leadership, decision-making, and communication with cross-functional teams like content, marketing, and sales. Start University wasn‚Äôt just a job‚Äîit was a professional platform where I **founded and led the UX/UI design area**, drove transformation, built scalable solutions, and helped bridge people to education through thoughtful digital design."

These websites focused on elegance, exclusivity, and ease of access to information and booking processes. For Grupo Tagle‚Äôs corporate site and motorcycle divisions (Motoplex and Royal Enfield), the goal was a clean, brand-aligned presence that inspired trust and action.\n\nAt Autocity and Grupo Tagle, I also had the opportunity to **establish the UX/UI design discipline from the ground up**, bringing structure and a user-centered mindset to a context that had previously relied on more traditional approaches.\n\nThis experience helped me apply my UX/UI design expertise to very different audiences and expectations, maintaining quality and performance across the board."

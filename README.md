# My Portfolio

V1.0.0.1

My Portfolio is a personal website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to showcase my professional experience, projects, and skills. It features a modern UI, dynamic project data, and optimized image handling using remote sources and a custom CMS. The site is fully responsive and leverages the latest Next.js features for performance and SEO.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family by Vercel.
